        <h1>About Working with Orca</h1>
        <p>This section deals primarily with explaining what you see on the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> screens and what you can do on them. Most topics relate to one screen in the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> application. You should read <a href="AboutConcepts.htm">Concepts</a> and perform the steps described in <a href="AboutGettingStarted.htm">Getting Started</a> before working on the screens described in the current section.</p>
