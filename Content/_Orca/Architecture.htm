        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">Currently Based only on k8s</p>

        <p class="h2">The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> Cloud Application</p>
        <p>This is the cloud-based user interface you log into from your browser. It provides you visualization of cluster security information such as network traffic, vulnerabilities, Kubernetes network policies and the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> security policy and for taking actions such as switching the policy mode, adding policy rules, getting API tokens and exporting policy rules. </p>
        <p class="h2">The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Agent" /></p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Agent" /> is installed on your Kubernetes cluster. It monitors traffic in the cluster, enforces your policy and communicates with the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> cloud application. <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" />'s capability of discovering new connections is referred to as <a href="Discovery.htm">Discovery</a>.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> services are deployed on your cluster in the Kube-System namespace and in a newly created namespace called Tufin-system. No <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> services are placed in user or application namespaces.</p>

        </p>
        <p>At installation time, Kubernetes determines one node on which to deploy the Kite pod. Kubernetes deploys the Network Monitor daemonset on every node in the cluster, where permissions allow.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Agent" /> contains the following services:</p>
        <p class="h3"><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Kite" /></p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Kite" /> is a pod that communicates between the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Agent" /> plugins and the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> application. It is installed on one node in the cluster, as determined by Kubernetes.</p>
        <p class="h3"><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> DNS Plugin</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> DNS plugin identifies traffic in the cluster between services and to external services and  blocks DNS requests that are not part of the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> security policy.  It acts as a proxy, processing all DNS queries before passing them to the Kubernetes DNS pod.</p>
        <p class="h3"><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> Network Monitor (Previously  Conntrack)</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> network monitor discovers IP and UDP connection requests, including IP ingress. It is deployed as a daemon set, on every node.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude" class="h3"><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> Istio Plugin</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">Applies the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> security policy to the cluster through Istio. Istio must be installed prior to <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> installation.</p>
