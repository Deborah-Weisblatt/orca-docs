        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> dashboard gives you a snapshot of your Kubernetes security issues vulnerabilities through charts:</p>
        <p class="h3" MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">Network Policy Namespace Coverage</p>
        <p class="normal" MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">This chart compares the number of namespaces having at least one Kubernetes network policy with namespaces that  have no network policies. The number of k8s network policies is not reflected here.</p>
        <p class="h3" MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">Namespace Vulnerabilities</p>
        <p class="normal" MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">This chart shows the number of namespaces for which container vulnerabilities were found against the highest severity of vulnerability found. The number of vulnerabilities found in each namespace is not reflected here. The vulnerability level for a namespace is the largest <a href="SecurityScore.htm">vulnerability</a> found in any of its containers.  </p>
        <p class="h3">Privileged Containers</p>
        <p>This is a list of containers for which privileged is set to true (privileged=true), therefore giving it access to all devices on the host. The <a href="SecurityScore.htm"><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.TufinScore" /></a>, which is not connected to the container privileged setting, is also shown to provide additional information.</p>
        <p class="h3">Pod Security</p>
        <p>This is a list of pods with a permissive pod security policy:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="Pod_Permissive_Policy.flsnp" />
        <p class="h3">Kubernetes Vulnerabilities</p>
        <p class="normal">This is a list of published vulnerabilities for your current k8s implementation, showing the CVE number and the version in which the vulnerability was fixed.</p>
