        <p>Kubernetes network policies don't apply to the host node's network, only to the virtual pod network. Therefore, pods running with hostNetwork set to true (<code>hostNetwork: true</code>)  can see all network interfaces of the host machine where the pod was initiated. The result is that Kubernetes network policies are bypassed for such pods and the application can communicate as if    running on the host node. </p>
