        <ul>
            <li>View the pods, services, nodes, Kubernetes network policies and network traffic in your cluster.</li>
            <li>Identify traffic  that is not compliant with your defined policy. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h2">Enforcement</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a security policy for the cluster</li>
            <li>Build Kubernetes network policies  from your policy</li>
            <li> Prevent access to and from selected domains</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h2">Automation</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Immutable policy control - automated policy creation built into your CI/CD pipeline. </li>
            <li>Scanning of Docker container images for vulnerabilities and giving an appropriate <MadCap:variable name="local.TufinScore" /> to each container. <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_L" /> computes a <MadCap:variable name="local.TufinScore" /> for each active service. The <MadCap:variable name="local.TufinScore" /> gives you instant insight into the security of the services you utilize in your application. This can be added as a step to your CI/CD pipeline.</li>
            <li>Integration of vulnerability scans into your code repository, implemented as a badge in your readme file. The Tufin badges are an effective way to highlight security issues to the application developers as they develop the application.</li>
            <li>Application of your policy to firewalls via <MadCap:variable name="local.SC" /> and directly on Microsoft's Azure Firewall.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h2">Supported Platforms</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> integrates into any Kubernetes platform, any build server, and any code repository. Your application can be deployed on any public cloud platform that supports Kubernetes, including AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenShift, Docker Enterprise, Minikube, VMware or on your own private on-premises cloud platform.</p>
