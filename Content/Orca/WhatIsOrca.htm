        <h1>What is <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" />?</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="WhatIsOrca.flsnp" />
        <p><a name="The"></a>The main functions provided by  <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Discovery and learning of network traffic movements in your cluster.</li>
            <li>Visibility of the network traffic movements in your cluster.</li>
            <li>Visibility of your Kubernetes network policy.</li>
            <li>Visibility of non-compliance of the actual network traffic in your cluster with your defined policy. </li>
            <li>Automated application of your security policy to your Kubernetes cluster. Implementation of an additional level of access control to and from the pods in your cluster over and above Kubernetes native network policy.</li>
            <li>Immutable policy control - automated application of your defined policy on newly-built container objects as part of your CI/CD pipeline. </li>
            <li>Scanning of Docker container images for vulnerabilities and giving an appropriate <MadCap:variable name="local.TufinScore" /> to each container. <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_L" /> computes a <MadCap:variable name="local.TufinScore" /> for each active service, based on a vulnerability scan of the underlying containers. The <MadCap:variable name="local.TufinScore" /> gives you instant insight into the security of the services you utilize in your application. This can be added as a step to your CI/CD pipeline.</li>
            <li>Integration of vulnerability scans into your code repository, implemented as a badge in your readme file.The Tufin badges are an effective way to highlight security issues to the application developers as they develop the application.</li>
            <li>Integration with <MadCap:variable name="local.SC" /> to apply your policy to firewalls in an automated fashion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> integrates into any Kubernetes platform, any build server, and any code repository. Your application can be deployed on any public cloud platform that supports Kubernetes, including AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenShift, Docker Enterprise, Minikube, or on your own private on-premises cloud platform.</p>
