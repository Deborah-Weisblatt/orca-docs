        <h1>Using the Help Center</h1>
        <h2>Screenshot Thumbnails</h2>
        <p>Many screenshots are initially shown as thumbnail pictures to reduce page size and make it easier for the reader to quickly understand the structure of the help page. Thumbnails are identified by the dotted frame surrounding the picture. Click on a thumbnail to expand the picture to full size. Click again minimize it.</p>

        <h2>Text Emphasis</h2>
        <p>Different font characteristics are used to distinguish between elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regular text</li>
            <li><span class="ScreenObject">Screen object</span> - either a complete screen or a component of it. Includes field names, screen names, buttons, screen panels and other components. This is used when describing an action on the screen object (like 'click <span class="ScreenObject">Continue</span>') or referring to it from another place, However, this is generally not used when describing the item itself, such as in a help document dedicated to it.</li>
            <li><span class="StatusOrValue">Field value</span> or <span class="StatusOrValue">status </span>(e.g. <span class="StatusOrValue">Learn Mode</span>, <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce Mode</span>, <span class="StatusOrValue">On</span>, <span class="StatusOrValue">Off</span>)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Screen Theme Colors</h2>
        <p>At any given time, the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> application screens will follow one  of two color themes, depending on the <a href="Settings.htm#LearningMode">Policy Mode</a> currently selected. The help screenshot may therefore appear with a different color theme than the one you currently see in the application. </p>
