        <h1>Architecture</h1>
        <h2>The <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> Application</h2>
        <p>The user interface for visualizing cluster security information such as network traffic, vulnerabilities, Kubernetes network policies and the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> security policy and for taking actions such as switching the policy mode, adding policy rules, getting API tokens and exporting policy rules. </p>
        <h2>The <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> Agent</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local.Kite" /> monitors traffic in your cluster, enforces your policy and communicates with the Orca application. The agent consists of the following primary services:</p>
        <h3><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> Kite</h3>
        <p>Communicates between the <MadCap:variable name="local.Kite" /> plugins and the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> application.</p>
        <h3><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> DNS plugin</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Acts as a proxy, processing all DNS queries before passing them to the Kubernetes DNS pod.</li>
            <li> Identifies traffic in the cluster between your services, as well as to external services. </li>
            <li> Blocks DNS requests that are not part of the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> security policy.  </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> IP  Plugin </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Employs the Conntrack daemon set </li>
            <li>Discovers IP connection requests, including ingress</li>
            <li>Discovers UDP connection requests</li>
            <li>Works for <MadCap:variable name="local.Openshift" /> only - soon to be extended to all implementations </li>
            <li>Works at the node level</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> Istio Plugin</h3>
        <p>Applies the Orca security policy to the cluster through Istio. Istio must be installed prior to <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> installation.</p>
        <h3>Discovery Engine</h3>
        <p>Not a service in itself but rather a concept in <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> that represents the identification mechanism of network traffic in your cluster. Comprised of other <MadCap:variable name="local.Kite" /> plugins.  See <a href="DiscoveryEngine.htm">Discovery Engine</a>.</p>
