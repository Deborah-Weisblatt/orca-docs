        <h1>CI/CD Pipeline</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> takes security policy automation right to your CI/CD pipeline with the following functions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Immutable Policy</p>
                <p>Replaces your cluster security policy with a brand new one as part of your CI build process. The new policy will allow  only the connections that you expect from the latest build of your application and this policy gets deployed at the same time as the deployment of your application. See <a href="ImmutablePolicy.htm">Immutable Policy</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Container Image Scanning</p>
                <p>Runs a deep analysis scan on your container images automatically as part of your CI build process and calculates a <a href="SecurityScore.htm"><MadCap:variable name="local.TufinScore" /></a>. The result of the last scan performed is displayed in <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> and can be displayed also in the form of a <a href="Badges.htm">badge</a>. See <a href="ImageScansCICD.htm">Image Scans in the CI/CD Pipeline.</a></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Both functions require the addition of commands to your CI/CD script.</p>
