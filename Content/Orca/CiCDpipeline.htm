        <h1>CI/CD Pipeline</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> takes security policy automation right to your CI/CD pipeline with the following functions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Immutable Policy</p>
                <p>Your security policy is replaced with a new one as part of your CI build process. The new policy will contain only allowed connections made in a dedicated phase of your build process, and this policy gets deployed at the same time as the deployment of your application. See <a href="ImmutablePolicy.htm">Immutable Policy</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Container Image Scanning</p>
                <p>A deep analysis scan is performed on your container images as part of your CI build process and calculates a <a href="SecurityScore.htm"><MadCap:variable name="local.TufinScore" /></a>. The result of the last scan performed is displayed in <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> and can be displayed also in the form of a <a href="Badges.htm">badge</a>. See <a href="ImageScansCICD.htm">Image Scans in the CI/CD Pipeline.</a></p>
