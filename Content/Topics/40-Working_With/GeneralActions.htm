        <h2><a name="Refreshi"></a>Refreshing the Page</h2>
        <p> While you are working in the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> application, the data displayed on the screen could become outdated due to external events such as Kubernetes network policy changes or actions of other <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> users such as adding allowed connections. When moving from one screen to another the new screen is always refreshed with the latest data but if you remain on the same screen, these changes are not automatically reflected. </p>
        <p>The current page can however be refreshed manually by clicking on the Refresh icon <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icon_Sync.png" /> at the top of the screen at any time.</p>
        <h2><a name="Sorting"></a>Sorting Table Columns</h2>
        <p>Most tables can be sorted in ascending or descending order by one or more columns. Click on the column header of column to sort by the contents of that column. Click again to reverse the sort order.</p>
        <h2><a name="Resizing"></a>Resizing Columns</h2>
        <p>Table column can be resized to make reading easier. Hover over a column divider in the header of a table, and drag the column separator bar right or left.</p>
