        <h1>Discovery Engine</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> Discovery Engine is a continually-running process that monitors traffic within your cluster. This information will provide you with visibility into traffic flows in the cluster and will help you formulate and manage your security policy. The Discovery Engine runs independently of the Policy Mode. </p>
        <p>Any traffic found that is not already listed as an allowed connection in your <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> policy or as a new connection in the New Connections Window is automatically logged to the New Connections Window, where it will remain  for up to one hour. Only one entry of traffic discovered between the same two points will be listed at any one time; if additional occurrences are discovered for a connection currently listed in the window, the time to keep it will be reset to another hour.</p>

        <p>The number of connections in the New Connections Window is displayed at the top of the screen . </p>
        <h2>From New Connections to Allowed Connections</h2>
        <p>New connections logged in the New Connections Window can be viewed and optionally converted to allowed connections in a mouse click - see <a href="../40-Working_With/AllowedConnections.htm">Security Policy</a>. </p>
        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>A notification can be sent whenever a new connection is discovered. See <a href="../40-Working_With/Settings.htm">Settings</a>.</p>
