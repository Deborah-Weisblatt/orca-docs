        <h1>Discovery Engine</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Local.Product_L" /> discovery engine is a continually running process that constantly monitors traffic to and from  the services used by your application. Any traffic found that is not already listed as an allowed connection in your policy is added to the New Connections Window and the number of new connections displayed on the screen is updated. Any connections discovered which are not listed as allowed connections in your <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> policy will be considered new connections. </p>
        <p>You can view the <span class="ScreenObject">New Connections Window</span> by clicking <span class="ScreenObject">New Connections</span> at the top of the screen. See also <a href="../40-Working_With/AllowedConnections.htm">Security Policy</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The Discovery Engine is always active, and runs independently of the Policy Mode. New connections can be converted to allowed connections.</p>
        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>A notification can be sent whenever a new connection is discovered. See <a href="../40-Working_With/Settings.htm">Settings</a>.</p>
