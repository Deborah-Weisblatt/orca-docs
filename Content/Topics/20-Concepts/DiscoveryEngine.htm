        <h1>Discovery Engine</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> Discovery Engine is a continually-running process that monitors traffic within your cluster. This information will provide you with visibility into traffic flows in the cluster and will help you formulate and manage your security policy. The Discovery Engine runs independently of the Policy Mode. </p>
        <p class="h2">What Type of Connections Does <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> discover?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TCP and UDP connections only</li>
            <li>Connections from pods assigned to services via a selector</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any traffic found that is not already listed as an allowed connection in your <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> policy or as a new connection in the New Connections Window is automatically displayed in the New Connections Window, where it will remain  for up to one hour. Only one occurrence of a connection made between two points will be listed at any one time; if additional occurrences are discovered for a connection currently listed in the window, the time to keep it will be reset to another hour. The source IP addresses are saved by <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" />.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The number of connections in the New Connections Window is displayed at the top of the screen . </p>
        <p>The window displays the following information:</p>

        <h2>From New Connections to Allowed Connections</h2>
        <p>New connections  in the New Connections Window can be viewed and optionally converted to allowed connections in a mouse click - see <a href="../40-Working_With/AllowedConnections.htm">Security Policy</a>. </p>
        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>A notification can be sent whenever a new connection is discovered. See <a href="../40-Working_With/Settings.htm">Settings</a>.</p>
