        <h1>Enforcement</h1>
        <h2>How does <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> enforce a security policy in your cluster?</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> enforces the security policy in your cluster using one or more mechanisms. Some are automatically applied when switching Policy Mode to <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce</span>, others must be initiated manually.</p>
        <h3>DNS - NX Domain</h3>
        <p>Applied automatically when <span class="StatusOrValue">Policy Mode</span> is set to <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce</span>.</p>
        <p>At installation time, the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> DNS&#160;Plugin is installed in the Kubernetes DNS&#160;pod, which then acts as a proxy, processing all DNS queries before passing them to the Kubernetes DNS. When <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> is set to <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce</span>, any DNS query that is not defined in <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> as an allowed connection returns an NX domain (non-existent domain). This enforcement method is not active when <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> is set to <span class="StatusOrValue">Learn</span>.</p>
        <p>Enforcement by DNS&#160;works for all supported Kubernetes implementations except <MadCap:variable name="local.Openshift" />, because it does not have a Kubernetes DNS.</p>
        <h3>Kubernetes Network Policies</h3>
        <p>Applied manually. You can apply the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> security policy to Kubernetes Network policies through a simple <a href="../40-Working_With/AllowedConnections.htm#Apply">export action</a>. The Kubernetes network policies will be automatically disabled by Orca when <span class="StatusOrValue">Policy Mode</span> is set to <span class="StatusOrValue">Learn</span> and enabled when set to <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce</span>.</p>
        <p>This works for all supported Kubernetes implementations.</p>
        <h3>Apply on Firewalls</h3>
        <p>Applied manually. You can issue a request to open SecureChange tickets for implementing the Orca security policy on firewalls. Requires Orca <a href="SecureChangeIntegration.htm">SecureChange integration</a>.</p>
        <h3>Istio Mesh</h3>
        <p>Applied automatically when <span class="StatusOrValue">Policy Mode</span> is set to <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce</span>, when Istio is installed on the cluster. Integration with Istio is not included in the default <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> installation. Contact Orca support for installation instructions. </p>
