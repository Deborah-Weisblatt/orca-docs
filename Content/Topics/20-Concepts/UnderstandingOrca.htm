        <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> is a cloud-based service. It communicates with your Kubernetes cluster using a pod  called Kite, which must be installed on your cluster. See also <a href="../10-What_is_Orca/WhatIsOrca.htm">What is Orca</a>.</p>
        <h2>Kite</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> Kite is responsible for monitoring your Kubernetes cluster for changes, such as adding or deleting services, and for maintaining ongoing communication between your cluster and the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> service. It communicates information to and from the main Orca application on the cloud.</p>
        <h2>Kubernetes DNS plugin</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> Kubernetes DNS plugin identifies and controls all communication between your services, as well as to external services. It identifies and controls communication based on DNS&#160;lookups (for example crm.mycompany.com).  <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> can also monitor and enforce service connectivity using <a href="https://istio.io/about/intro/">Istio</a>, which adds support for identification and control of communication through sidecar proxies. The DNS plugin is installed together with Kite.</p>
        <p>See <a href="../30-Getting_Started/DeployOrca.htm">Installation</a> of Kite and the  DNS plugin on your Kubernetes cluster. </p>
        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> identifies network traffic in your cluster and allows you to view the traffic routes discovered. You can add any of these routes as rules to your policy. See <a href="DiscoveryEngine.htm">Discovery Engine</a></p>
