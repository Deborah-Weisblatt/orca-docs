        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> is a cloud service that requires some components to be installed on your Kubernetes cluster.</p>
        <h2>The Orca Agent</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local.Kite" /> is responsible for monitoring your Kubernetes cluster for changes, such as adding or deleting services, and for maintaining ongoing communication between your cluster and the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> service. It communicates information to and from the main Orca application on the cloud.</p>
        <h2>Kubernetes DNS plugin</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> Kubernetes DNS plugin identifies and controls all communication between your services, as well as to external services. It identifies and controls communication based on DNS&#160;lookups (for example crm.mycompany.com).  <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> can also monitor and enforce service connectivity using <a href="https://istio.io/about/intro/">Istio</a>, which adds support for identification and control of communication through sidecar proxies.

        <h2>Discovery Engine</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> identifies network traffic in your cluster. You can create policy rules easily, based on the traffic discovered. See <a href="DiscoveryEngine.htm">Discovery Engine</a></p>
