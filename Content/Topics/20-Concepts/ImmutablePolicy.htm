        <h1>Immutable Policy</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> provides you with a way to implement your security policy automatically and the Base mechanism employed for this is the creation of an immutable security policy. Immutable means fixed and unchangeable. That doesn't mean the fast-changing threat landscape isn't going to be met by equally rapid changes to your security rules, it just means that instead of modifying your security policy, you introduce a new improved one then dispose of the old one.</p>
        <h2>Advantages of an Immutable Security Policy</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Immutable Security Policy Workflow</h2>
        <p>This basic concept of immutability, replacement and disposal is central to automating a security policy but there are other related processes that need to be employed for the desired result to be achieved. </p>

        <p>Production-Like Environment</p>
        <p>You will need an environment </p>
        <p>Reset Policy</p>
        <p>Policy as Code</p>
        <p>Developer:</p>
        <p>1.	Develop</p>
        <p>2.	Commit code</p>
        <p>Build System:</p>
        <p>3.	Check out code</p>
        <p>4.	Build</p>
        <p>5.	Reset policy</p>
        <p>6.	Run tests: unit, integration, system...</p>
        <p>7.	Fetch auto-generated Policy</p>
        <p>8.	Commit auto-generated policy to github as YAML</p>
        <p>9.	Check policy for compliance</p>
        <p>10.	Deploy the app and the auto-generated policy to a run-time environment (staging or production)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>But there is in fact much more to it than that</p>
        <p>it and replace it The idea is that instead of modifying the existing While at first sight this may appear to conflict with the reality of a fast-changing threat landscape that requires equally rapid changes to security rules, </p>
