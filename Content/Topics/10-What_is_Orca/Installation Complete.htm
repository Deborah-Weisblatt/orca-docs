        <h1>Installation Complete, What Next?</h1>
        <p class="h2">Use Case:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You've just <a href="../30-Getting_Started/DeployOrca.htm">installed </a><MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> on your cluster and you've <a href="../30-Getting_Started/CheckItsWorking.htm">checked it's working</a></li>
            <li>Now it's time to build an initial security policy</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h2">Why?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To know when new connections are made that you haven't approved, with the option of receiving instant alerts.</li>
            <li>To have a clear and documented set of security rules for your cluster that you can review anytime and present to whoever you choose.</li>
            <li>To apply your policy to your cluster as Kubernetes network policies</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="h2">How?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure there has been activity in your cluster for an hour at least.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Go to Orca and look at the New Connections indicator. If your cluster is active you should see that new connections have been discovered.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on the new connections window, review the connections displayed and add those representing desired traffic to your policy</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Go to Security Policy - Allowed Connections and review the rules.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Add any additional policy rules you think necessary, or wait for the connections to be made so you can review them in the new connections list, the same way as you did the previous ones.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You now have an initial security policy set up. But, It's not yet being enforced.</p>
