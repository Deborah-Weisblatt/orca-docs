        <p>Kubernetes network policies apply only to the virtual pod network and not to the host node's network (i.e. the host machine on which the pod was initiated). Pods running with hostNetwork enabled (<code>hostNetwork: true</code>)  therefore bypass all <MadCap:variable name="local.Kubernetes" /> <MadCap:variable name="local.NetworkPolicies" />. Additionally they can see all network interfaces of the host  and the application can communicate as if    running on the host itself. </p>
