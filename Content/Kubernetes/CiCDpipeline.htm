            <MadCap:concept term="Kubernetes" />CI/CD Pipeline</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> takes security policy automation right to your CI/CD pipeline with the following functions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Immutable Policy</p>
                <p>Your security policy is replaced with a new one as part of your CI build process. The new policy will contain only allowed connections made in a dedicated phase of your build process, and this policy gets deployed at the same time as the deployment of your application. See <a href="ImmutablePolicy.htm">Immutable Policy</a>.</p>
