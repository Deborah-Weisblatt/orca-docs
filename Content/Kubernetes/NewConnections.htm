        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> continually monitors traffic in your cluster, providing you with visibility into traffic flow and discovering new connections and in doing so, helps you formulate your security policy. Monitoring takes place whatever the <a href="../SecureCloud/ConceptOfPolicy.htm#policymode">Policy Mode</a>. </p>
        <p class="h3">What Type of Connections Does <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> discover?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TCP and UDP connections </li>
            <li>Connections between service pods</li>
            <li>Connections from ingress to service pods</li>
            <li>Connections from service pods to external end-points</li>
            <li>Connections from the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Agent" /> to pull your container images for analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any traffic found that is not already listed as an allowed connection in your <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> policy  is automatically displayed in <MadCap:variable name="local.NewConnections" />, where it will remain  for up to one hour. Only one occurrence of a connection made between two points will be listed at any one time; if additional occurrences are discovered for a connection currently listed in the window, the time to keep it will be reset to another hour. <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> stores the IP addresses for sources of inbound connections (ingress) and destinations of outbound connections (egress). These IPs are used when generating Kubernetes network policies.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The number of connections  is displayed at the top of the screen. Each connection displays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SpecialBold">Source</span>
                </p>
                <p>The name of the service from which the connection was initiated, or 'ingress' if the connection was initiated from outside the cluster</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SpecialBold">Source Namespace</span>
                </p>
                <p>The namespace containing the source service</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SpecialBold">Destination</span>
                </p>
                <p>The name of the service to which the connection was made  or a domain/sub-domain name if the connection was made to a destination outside of the cluster</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SpecialBold">Destination Namespace</span>
                </p>
                <p>The namespace containing the destination service</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h3">Connections - Allowed or Blocked?</p>
        <p>When the <a href="../SecureCloud/ConceptOfPolicy.htm#policymode">Policy Mode</a> is set to <span class="StatusOrValue">Learn</span>, all new connections listed are allowed and when the <span class="StatusOrValue">Policy Mode</span> is set to <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce </span>all new connections are blocked. </p>
        <p class="h3">Notifications</p>
        <p>A notification can be sent whenever a new connection is discovered. See <a href="OrcaSettingsNotifications.htm">Notifications and Alerts</a>.</p>

                <p><span class="SpecialBold">Turn new connections into policy rules (allowed connections)</span>
                </p>
                <p>Select one or more new connections and click <span class="ScreenObject">Add to Policy</span>. The selected rules will be added to your security policy and removed from the current display and the number of new connections displayed will be updated accordingly.</p>
