        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local.ServiceGraph" /> graphically displays all the connections made between the services used in your web application and external services outside the cluster. The specific time frame that traffic is treated as active is configurable. If no connections are made to a service during the time frame selected, it will not appear in the <MadCap:variable name="local.ServiceGraph" />. Every service displayed has an associated <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.TufinScore" />.</p>

        <p>Clicking on a <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.TufinScore" /> displays the <a href="VulnerabilityDetails.htm">Vulnerabilities</a> page, which gives a list of vulnerabilities associated with that service.</p><a name="ServiceDetails"></a>
        <h3>View Reputation Information </h3>
        <p>Clicking on an external end-point will display an analysis of the site's reputation including information about the domain and a high-level vulnerability summary.</p>
        <p>The analysis information is provided through a 3rd party called Reposify. If Reposify doesn't have data for the site, you will be automatically redirected to the appropriate page on the Talos reputation website (<a href="http://www.talosintelligence.com/">www.talosintelligence.com</a>).</p>
        <h3><a name="ConnectionHistory"></a>Traffic Time Frame</h3>
        <p>The Traffic Time Frame is the length of time that <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_L" /> considers a connection as active. Connections are displayed in the Service Graph for services that have had active traffic during the time frame selected. If no traffic has originated from or into a service during the time frame selected, that service will not appear in the Service Graph.</p>
