        <p class="h2">The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> Cloud Application</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Kubernetes" />This is the cloud-based user interface you log into from your browser. It gives you a clear and easy to understand view of the cluster including workloads, network connectivity, vulnerabilities and Kubernetes network policies. Actions include switching the policy mode, adding policy rules, getting API tokens and exporting policy rules. </p>
        <p class="h2">The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Agent" /></p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Agent" /> is installed on your Kubernetes cluster. It monitors traffic in the cluster, <a href="Discovery.htm">discovers new connections</a>, enforces your policy and communicates with the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> cloud application. <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> services are deployed on your cluster in the Kube-System namespace and in a new namespace called Tufin-system, which is created in the installation process. No <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> services are placed in user or application namespaces. The affected namespaces are illustrated below.</p>

        <p><span class="SpecialBold">SecureCloud on your Cluster - Namespaces</span>
        </p>
        <p>At installation time, Kubernetes determines the node on which to deploy the Kite pod and deploys the Network Monitor daemonset on every node in the cluster, where permissions allow. This is represented by the illustration below.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Agent" /> contains the following services:</p>
        <p class="h3"><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Kite" /></p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Kite" /> is a pod that communicates between the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Agent" /> plugins and the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> application. It is installed on one node in the cluster, as determined by Kubernetes.</p>
        <p class="h3"><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> DNS Plugin</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> DNS plugin identifies traffic in the cluster between services and to external services and  blocks DNS requests that are not part of the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> security policy.  It acts as a proxy, processing all DNS queries before passing them to the Kubernetes DNS pod.</p>
        <p class="h3"><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> Network Monitor</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> network monitor discovers IP and UDP connection requests, including IP ingress. It is deployed as a daemon set, on every node.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude" class="h3"><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> Istio Plugin</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">Applies the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> security policy to the cluster through Istio. Istio must be installed prior to <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> installation.</p>
