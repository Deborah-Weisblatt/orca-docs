        <h1>Monitoring Your Application</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Product_S" /> has now been deployed on your cluster. You can now start monitoring your application.</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Log in to <MadCap:variable name="General.Product_S" />. If this is your first time, login by using the <b>Set Password</b> link and <b>user name</b> provided in your <a href="SignUp.htm">Sign Up</a> email.</li>
                <li>Go to Services. If the services appear, you're all set! If not, there may be a connectivity issue between your cluster and Orca - please verify that all the ports listed in <a href="DeployOrca.htm#Installa">Outbound Connections </a>are allowed.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>The service graph will show traffic as soon as it is generated in the cluster.</p>
                    <p>For continuous security, we recommend that you automate this step by running system tests on your application.</p>
                </li>
                <li>If your cluster is hosted on <MadCap:variable name="General.Docker" /> and you want to use the vulnerability scan feature, follow the steps in <a href="DeployOrca_Docker_Image_Scanning.htm">Docker Image Scanning</a>. This can be done later.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Build your enforcement Policy using the <a href="../TopicsFeatures/Discovery.htm">Discovery</a> engine.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You can choose whether to enforce the policy you created by toggling <a href="../TopicsFeatures/Settings.htm#LearningMode">Learning Mode</a> on or off.</p>
