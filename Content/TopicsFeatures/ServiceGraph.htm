        <p>The Service Graph graphically displays all the active traffic between the services used in your web application, and external services outside the cluster. The specific time frame that traffic is treated as active is configurable. If traffic between two services has not occurred during the time frame selected, the services will not appear in the Services Graph. Every service displayed has an associated color-coded <MadCap:variable name="local.TufinScore" /> that shows how secure the service is.</p>

        <h3><a name="ConnectionHistory"></a>Traffic Time Frame</h3>
        <p>The Traffic Time Frame is the length of time that <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_L" /> considers a connection as active. Connections are displayed in the Service Graph for services that have had active traffic during the time frame selected. If no traffic has originated from or into a service during the time frame selected, that service will not appear in the Service Graph.</p>
