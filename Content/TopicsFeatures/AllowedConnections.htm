        <h1>Allowed Connections</h1>
        <p>Allowed connections are the rules governing network traffic in your cluster, constituting a policy that can be enforced on your cluster whenever you choose. These rules can define namespaces, services and DNS names. Unlike firewall rules, they do not define IP addresses. Initially the list is empty and new allowed connections are defined manually, optionally assisted by the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> discovery engine.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/ScreenPolicyAllowedConnections.png" class="ThumbnailPopup" />
        </p>
        <p>Your policy will always be in one of two modes - learning mode or enforcement mode. When in learning mode, <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> will not apply any limitations on traffic in the cluster. When in enforce mode, <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> will apply limitations on the traffic. Switching modes is done in <a href="Settings.htm">Settings</a>. To see how to get here <a href="#How">look here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Deleting an Allowed Connection</h3>
        <p>Rules can be deleted from the security policy at any time. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hover over the line for the appropriate rule and click <img src="../Resources/Images/ButtonX.png" class="noborder" />when it appears on the line.</li>
            <li>The allowed connection will be removed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="Locking"></a>Locking / Unlocking an Allowed Connection</h3>
        <p>The purpose of locking rules is to prevent them from being deleted when resetting allowed connections. However, a locked rule can individually be deleted in the same way as an unlocked rule. Rules can be locked and unlocked in the security policy at any time. </p>
        <p>To lock a rule:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hover over the line for the appropriate rule and click the lock icon when it appears on the line.</li>
            <li>Thereafter, the rule will display the lock icon all the time.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Resetting Allowed Connections</h3>
        <p>Resetting allowed connections restores your policy to a base-line of allowed rules. All rules that have been locked constitute your base-line and if no rules have been locked, your base-line is a policy with no rules whatsoever.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">Actions</span>  to display the <span class="ScreenObject">Actions</span> menu.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/PolicyActionsResetAllowed.png" title="Reset Allowed Connections" alt="Reset Allowed Connections" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">Reset Allowed Connections</span> from the menu.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All allowed connections will be deleted from the security policy, except those that are <a href="#Locking">locked</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Apply on Firewall</h3>
        <p>The apply on firewalls function is available only if you have a network policy change management solution such as <MadCap:variable name="local.SC" /> integrated with <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_L" />. It applies the security policy you have defined in <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> to the devices managed by submitting one or more firewall change tickets to the network policy change management solution. A ticket will be submitted for each namespace in your policy. </p>
        <p>After the apply on firewalls process is initiated, it cannot be initiated again until all tickets have been implemented. If not all tickets have been implemented following a prior attempt, the menu option will be greyed out and followed by "(in-progress)". This status will remain until all prior tickets have been resolved and implemented or deleted in the network policy change management system.</p>
        <p>After the apply on firewalls process is initiated, the tickets created can be seen on the <a href="FirewallTickets.htm">Firewall Tickets Screen</a>, together with their status. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">Actions</span>  to display the <span class="ScreenObject">Actions Menu</span>.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">Apply on Firewalls</span> from the menu. This will initiate the process and change the option in the <span class="ScreenObject">Actions Menu</span> to be greyed out and followed by "(in-progress)". You cannot initiate the process further time until the menu option is restored to its normal state.</p>
