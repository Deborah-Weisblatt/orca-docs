        <h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
        <p>Allowed connections are the rules governing network traffic in your cluster, constituting a security policy that can be enforced on your cluster whenever you choose. These rules can define namespaces, services and DNS names. Unlike firewall rules, they do not define IP addresses. Initially the list contains a single rule from Kite to tufin.io and new allowed connections are defined manually, optionally assisted by the <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> discovery engine. The Kite rule should not be deleted or changed. However, it can be recreated manually or with the help of discovery.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Your policy will always be in one of two modes - <span class="state">Learn</span> or <span class="state">Enforce</span> . When in <span class="state">Learn</span> mode, <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> will not apply any limitations on traffic in the cluster. When in <span class="state">Enforce</span> mode, <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> will apply limitations on the traffic. Switching modes is done in <a href="Settings.htm">Settings</a>.

        <h3>Deleting an Allowed Connection</h3>
        <p>Rules can be deleted from the security policy at any time. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hover over the line for the appropriate rule and click <img src="../Resources/Images/IconRemove.png" class="noborder" />when it appears on the line.</li>
            <li>The allowed connection will be removed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="Locking"></a>Locking / Unlocking an Allowed Connection</h3>
        <p>The purpose of locking rules is to prevent them from being deleted when resetting allowed connections. However, a locked rule can individually be deleted in the same way as an unlocked rule. Rules can be locked and unlocked in the security policy at any time. </p>
        <p>To lock a rule:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hover over the line for the appropriate rule and click the Lock icon <img src="../Resources/Images/IconUnlock.png" class="noborder" /> when it appears on the line.</li>
            <li>Thereafter, the rule will display the Locked icon <img src="../Resources/Images/IconLocked.png" class="noborder" /> all the time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To unlock a rule:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the Locked icon <img src="../Resources/Images/IconLocked.png" class="noborder" /> on the desired line.</li>
            <li>The Locked icon will be removed from the line.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Resetting Allowed Connections</h3>
        <p>Resetting allowed connections restores your policy to a base-line of allowed rules. All rules that have been locked constitute your base-line and if no rules have been locked, your base-line is a policy with no rules whatsoever.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">Actions</span>  to display the <span class="ScreenObject">Actions</span> menu.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MenuSecurityPolicyActions.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">Reset Allowed Connections</span> from the menu.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All allowed connections will be deleted from the security policy, except those that are <a href="#Locking">locked</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="Apply"></a>Export as Network Policies</h3>
        <p>The set of allowed connections - your network policy - can be exported as a YAML file which can be used to create rules in your Kubernetes cluster. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">Actions</span>  to display the <span class="ScreenObject">Actions</span> menu.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MenuSecurityPolicyActions.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">Export as network policies </span>from the menu.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A file named domain-&lt;your cluster name&gt;.yml will be downloaded via the browser.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Take the appropriate actions described in the Kubernetes documentation to create the policies on your cluster.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Apply on Firewalls</h3>
        <p>Apply on firewalls applies the security policy you have defined in <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" /> to the devices managed by submitting one or more firewall change tickets to your network policy change management solution. The 'apply on firewalls' function is available <span class="Bold">only</span> if you have a network policy change management solution such as <MadCap:variable name="local.SC" /> integrated with <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_L" />. Currently, <MadCap:variable name="local.SC" /> is the only application that can be integrated in this way. If there is no integration, the Apply on Firewalls option in the menu will be greyed out and unclickable, and it will show as "Apply on Firewalls (Disabled)".</p>
        <p>A ticket will be submitted for each namespace in your policy. </p>
        <p>After the apply on firewalls process is initiated, it cannot be initiated again until all tickets have been successfully implemented. If not all tickets have been implemented following a prior attempt, the menu option will be greyed out and it will show as "Apply on Firewalls (in-progress)". This status will remain until all prior tickets have been resolved and implemented or deleted in the network policy change management system.</p>
        <p>After the apply on firewalls process is initiated, the tickets created can be seen on the <a href="FirewallTickets.htm">Firewall Tickets Screen</a>, together with their status. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">Actions</span>  to display the <span class="ScreenObject">Actions Menu</span>.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">Apply on Firewalls</span> from the menu. This will initiate the process and change the option in the <span class="ScreenObject">Actions Menu</span> to be greyed out and followed by "(in-progress)". You cannot initiate the process further time until the menu option is restored to its normal state. This will happen automatically when the last ticket is implemented successfully, or deleted in the change management system. Change system management tickets cannot be deleted within <MadCap:variable name="local.Product_S" />.</p>
