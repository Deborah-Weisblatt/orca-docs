        <h1>The Concept of Policy</h1>
        <p>Policy is a guide to how things should work. Specifically, security policies are sets of rules describing permitted and/or denied actions</p>
        <p class="h2"><MadCap:variable name="local.Public Cloud" /> Policy</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="local.Cloud Policy" /> is a set of rules that define the connectivity you want to allow  to and from your assets. <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" />'s <a href="../_Iris/Global_View.htm">global application visibility</a> presents your cloud environment as applications, so you can see compliance with policy  at the level of your business applications as well. Rules consist of source, destination and type of service, where source and destination are based on subnet, asset tags or other asset properties. Once your policy is defined in <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" />, you have a security baseline against which your cloud asset and application connectivity can be compared. <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> will report any violations of the policy after considering all the relevant security entities and network connectivity. <MadCap:snippetText src="../_Iris/WhatIsViolation.flsnp" /> </p>
        <p>Example of applications on the <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.GlobalMap" /> with policy violations marked in red:</p>

        <p class="h2"><MadCap:variable name="local.Cluster Policy" />
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../_Orca/WhatIsClusterPolicy.flsnp" />
        <p class="h3"><a name="policymode"></a>Policy Mode</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> has 2 modes of operation or <span class="ScreenObject">Policy Modes</span> - <span class="StatusOrValue">Learn</span> and <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce</span>. <span class="StatusOrValue">Learn</span> mode lets you monitor your application without blocking traffic between services or containers so you can learn about the traffic connections between the services used in your Kubernetes cluster. Enforce applies your policy to the traffic in the cluster, allowing only traffic defined by the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> policy rules. The  monitoring and visibility capabilities  such as <a href="../_Orca/ServiceGraph.htm">Service Graph</a>, <a href="../_Orca/Pods.htm">Pods</a>, and <a href="../_Orca/Services.htm">Services</a> are always available, and are independent of the mode setting. Policy Mode can be changed in <a href="../_Orca/OrcaSettingsGeneral.htm">Settings</a>.</p>
        <div class="NoteLight">Enforce mode is not currently supported for <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Openshift" />.</div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use <span class="StatusOrValue">Learn</span> while you are building a <a href="Policy.htm">Policy</a> for your organization. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Switch to <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce</span> when you are satisfied that the policy meets your enforcement criteria.</p>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Warning Enforce.flsnp" />
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> employs a theme color specific to the current mode selected, which affects the top toolbar and some screen elements such as buttons. When in <span class="StatusOrValue">Learn</span> mode, the <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> theme is colored <img src="../_Orca-Images/ColorLearn.png" class="noborder" /> and  when in <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce</span> mode, the theme is colored <img src="../_Orca-Images/ColorEnforce.png" class="noborder" />.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="h3">Kubernetes Network Policy and Learn Mode</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> can prevent the Kubernetes network policies from blocking traffic and interfering with the learning process. When this option is enabled  and Policy Mode is set to <span class="StatusOrValue">Learn</span>, <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> creates an Any-Any-Allow Kubernetes network  policy (marked with a label), which allows all traffic, for each monitored namespace. These policies are removed if Policy Mode is set to <span class="StatusOrValue">Enforce</span> or the option is disabled. </p>
