        <h1>Initial Setup</h1>
        <p>Congrat's! You've signed up for <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> and logged in. The next stage is to get <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> to monitor your  public cloud, Kubernetes clusters and on-premise network so you can get visibility into how secure they are and block access that shouldn't be allowed. This is done separately for each environment - cloud, k8s and on-premise:</p>
        <p>Every time you log in, the dashboard is the first thing you see; it  consists of risk charts for the environments that have been set up and Start buttons for environments not yet set up. Until you set up at least one of these environments, the following screen is displayed:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Start monitoring your public cloud by clicking on the public cloud <span class="ScreenObject">Start</span> button. This will take you to the <a href="../_Iris/AccountManager.htm">Account Manager</a>, where you will enter the credentials for all the cloud accounts you want to monitor.</li>
            <li>Start monitoring your Kubernetes clusters by <a href="../_Orca/DeployOrca.htm">installing <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /></a> on your clusters.</li>
