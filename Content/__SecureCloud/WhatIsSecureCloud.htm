        <p>Robust network security requires both visibility and policy. <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName_Long" /> is a cloud security tool that gives you comprehensive cloud security through unique visibility into your cloud environments and a well-defined security policy. <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> monitors Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure accounts and will in the future be extended to other cloud vendors as well.</p>
        <p class="h2"><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> and Visibility</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName_Long" /> is a security visualization and monitoring solution for cloud that lets you view your cloud environment not just as assets i.e. individual servers or services, but in terms of applications that provide a complete business service consisting of multiple distributed assets . See how in <a href="../_Iris/Global_View.htm">Global Application Visibility</a>. Furthermore <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> lets you look beyond individual cloud accounts and see a single combined environment consisting of multiple cloud vendors and accounts. </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> monitors your cloud accounts through API's and combines the information gathered with resource metadata to visualize cloud application access connectivity. It brings you the security status   of your applications by highlighting applications and assets that violate the policy you have defined.</p>
        <p class="normal"><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" />'s global application visibility is expressed at three levels: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.GlobalMap" />: A topological map of your applications in the cloud, showing their connections outside of the application and compliance with your security policy.</li>
            <li>Applications: A topological map of a single application, showing connectivity between its assets and drill down to see application and compliance details.</li>
            <li>Assets: View your assets and drill down  to see asset and compliance details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h2"><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> and Security Policy</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> lets you define a global security policy that is checked against the effective connectivity set up in  your cloud vendor accounts to discover violations and configuration issues in your environment. See more in <a href="ConceptOfPolicy.htm">Policy</a>.</p>
        <p class="h2">How <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> Helps Your Organization</p>
        <p>To identify cloud resource configuration errors and risks IT teams have relied upon tools that often present lists of hundreds, if not thousands of potential risks. Faced with an overwhelming list and an insufficient context, it is nearly impossible to prioritize issues to resolve. As a result, IT may waste precious time on false positives, or worse, do nothing. </p>
        <p>Tufin <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> takes an application-centric approach to securing your business. With <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> you gain clear visibility into risk exposure and security policy automation enabling IT to quickly respond to critical applications most under threats.</p>

        <p class="h2">Visibility</p>
        <ul>
            <li>View the pods, services, nodes, Kubernetes network policies and network traffic in your cluster.</li>
            <li>Identify traffic  that is not compliant with your defined policy. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h2">Enforcement</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a security policy for the cluster</li>
            <li>Build Kubernetes network policies  from your policy</li>
            <li> Prevent access to and from selected domains</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h2">Automation</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Immutable policy control - automated policy creation built into your CI/CD pipeline. </li>
            <li>Scanning of Docker container images for vulnerabilities and giving an appropriate <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.TufinScore" /> to each container. <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_L" /> computes a <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.TufinScore" /> for each active service. The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.TufinScore" /> gives you instant insight into the security of the services you utilize in your application. This can be added as a step to your CI/CD pipeline.</li>
            <li>Integration of vulnerability scans into your code repository, implemented as a badge in your readme file. The Tufin badges are an effective way to highlight security issues to the application developers as they develop the application.</li>
            <li>Application of your policy to firewalls via <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.SC" /> and directly on Microsoft's Azure Firewall.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h2">Supported Platforms</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> integrates into any Kubernetes platform, any build server, and any code repository. Your application can be deployed on any public cloud platform that supports Kubernetes, including AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenShift, Docker Enterprise, Minikube and VMware.</p>
