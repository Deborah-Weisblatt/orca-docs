        <h1>Global Application Visibility</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> sees your different cloud accounts through API's and combines the information it finds into a single global view. Then, rather than presenting the servers and services residing there as they are displayed in your cloud accounts - i.e. as individual assets, <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> aggregates them into distinct applications that provide a complete business service, such as a web service or SaaS application. This global view lets you see the effective connections to and from your distributed cloud applications across multiple cloud vendors and accounts and shows you how those connections comply with  your security policy. The correlation between your organization's business applications and <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" />'s applications is achieved through tags.</p>
