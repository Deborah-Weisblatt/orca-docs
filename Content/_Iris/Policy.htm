        <h1>Policy</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> policy is a set of rules that define the connectivity you want to allow  to and from your assets. <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" />'s <a href="Global_View.htm">global application visibility</a> presents your cloud environment as applications, so you can see compliance with policy  at the level of your business applications as well. Rules consist of source, destination and type of service, where source and destination are based on subnet, asset tags or other asset properties. Once your policy is defined in <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" />, you have a security baseline against which your cloud asset and application connectivity can be compared. <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> will report any violations of the policy after considering all the relevant security entities and network connectivity. <MadCap:snippetText src="WhatIsViolation.flsnp" /> </p>
