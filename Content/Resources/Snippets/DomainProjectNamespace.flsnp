        <p>When you <a href="../../Orca/SignUp.htm">sign up</a> for a <MadCap:variable name="Local.Product_L" /> account, a domain is assigned to you, based on  your email address. Additionally, you set a project name, which represents your first Kubernetes cluster. An <MadCap:variable name="Local.Product_S" /> user can have access to one or more domains and each domain can contain  one or more projects, but only one project can be displayed at a time. The currently selected domain and project are displayed in the top bar of the application.</p>
        <p>A Kubernetes cluster can contain multiple namespaces. The data displayed in Orca can be aggregated from any number of these.</p>
