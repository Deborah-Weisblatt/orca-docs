            <MadCap:concept term="PublicCloud" />Global Application Visibility</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> shows you the content of all your cloud accounts as global applications, regardless of vendor account or asset  location, as opposed to the traditional listings of the servers and services in each cloud account. <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> aggregates your assets into distinct applications that represent a complete business service, such as a web service or SaaS application. This global view lets you see the effective connections to and from your distributed cloud applications across multiple cloud vendors and accounts and shows you how those connections comply with  your security policy. The correlation between your organization's business applications and <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" />'s applications is achieved through tags.</p>
