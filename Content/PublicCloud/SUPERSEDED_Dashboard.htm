        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> dashboard is a high-level graphical summary of  important security issues detected in your cloud account setup. It can be displayed for <a href="Applications.htm">applications</a> or <a href="Assets.htm">assets</a> and you can click on the <span class="ScreenObject">View issue list</span> link for a chart to display the applications or assets at risk.</p>

        <p class="h3">Risky Ports</p>
        <p>Port 23, 110, 135-139, 445 and 3389 are considered high risk for various different reasons and allowing traffic to reach your assets from any of these could leave it open to attack. Click on <span class="ScreenObject">View issue list</span> to display all <a href="Applications.htm">applications</a> or <a href="Assets.htm">assets</a> allowing access through these ports.</p>
        <p>Recommended best practice: In your cloud account security definitions, do not allow ingress from any of the ports listed above. </p>
        <p class="h3">Permissive Access</p>
        <p>The permissive access chart presents a comparison between applications or assets with ingress access (UDP or TCP) in any of the following circumstances. :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>From any port (Min=0, Max=65535)</li>
            <li>Via transport access  from an unlimited range of IPs (class A subnet mask  e.g. 255.0.0.0/8)</li>
            <li>From any source (Source=ANY)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click on <span class="ScreenObject">View issue list</span> to display all <a href="Applications.htm">applications</a> or <a href="Assets.htm">assets</a> that have permissive access. Recommended best practice: In your cloud account security definitions, avoid the use of unlimited ranges; allow traffic to assets only through well-defined ports and IP addresses.</p>
        <p class="h3">Policy Violations</p>
        <p>The policy violations chart presents a comparison between the number of applications or assets that are compliant with your policy and those that violate the policy. <MadCap:snippetText src="WhatIsCloudViolation.flsnp" /> Click on <span class="ScreenObject">View issue list</span> to display all <a href="Applications.htm">applications</a> or <a href="Assets.htm">assets</a> with policy violations.</p>
        <p>Recommended best practice:&#160;Review your applications and assets and <a href="Assets.htm#Resolve">resolve</a> all violations.</p>
        <p class="h3">Internet Access</p>
        <p>The internet access chart presents a comparison between the number of applications or assets having access to or from the internet and those that don't have access. Click on <span class="ScreenObject">View issue list</span> to display all <a href="Applications.htm">applications</a> or <a href="Assets.htm">assets</a> that have access to the internet.</p>
        <p>Recommended best practice: Limit internet access to as few devices as possible and ensure only approved assets have such access.</p>
        <p class="h3">Tagging Alignment</p>
        <p>The tagging alignment chart presents a comparison between applications or assets  that have asset tags associated with them and those that do not. Click on <span class="ScreenObject">View issue list</span> to display all <a href="Applications.htm">applications</a> or <a href="Assets.htm">assets</a> that have no tags.</p>
        <p>Recommended best practice: Use tags to define important asset characteristics such as application and environment, as described in <a href="Global_View.htm">Global Application Visibility</a>.</p>
