        <h1>What is <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" />?</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName_Long" />  is a security monitoring and management solution for public cloud and Kubernetes that gives you three key requirements needed for robust network security:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SpecialBold">Visibility</span> into your public cloud and Kubernetes environments that graphically displays elements and connectivity</li>
            <li>An easy way to create and manage a security <span class="SpecialBold">policy</span> through rules </li>
            <li><span class="SpecialBold">Enforcement</span> of your policy to secure the network</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These capabilities help you identify security risks and address them fast. At the public cloud level, <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> monitors and maps out your Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure accounts and highlights deviations from security best practices. At the <MadCap:variable name="local.Kubernetes" /> cluster level, <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> gives you visibility  into cluster workloads, connectivity and lets you enforce your security policy. Advanced <span class="SpecialBold"><MadCap:variable name="local.Kubernetes" /> automation</span> features allow you to 'left-shift' security to your repository and CI/CD&#160;processes.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> structure diagram below lays out the functionality of the product in the sequence of the <a href="Navigation.htm#menu">main menu</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="SubHead1"> Visibility</p>
        <p class="normal">At the top of the visibility heirarchy is the <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> dashboard. It highlights primary areas of concern in your networks such as overly <MadCap:variable name="local.permissivepolicies" />, and <MadCap:variable name="local.risky ports (lower case)" />
      
         with a drill-down capability that leads you to the issues you need to address. Read more in <MadCap:xref href="Dashboard.htm">Dashboard</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName_Long" /> gives you a way to view your <MadCap:variable name="local.public cloud" /> environment not just as a collection of servers and services, but as complete business applications, even when they consist of multiple distributed assets - see <a href="../PublicCloud/Global_View.htm">Global Application Visibility</a>. Furthermore <MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> lets you look beyond individual cloud accounts and see a single combined environment consisting of multiple cloud vendors and accounts. </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> monitors your cloud accounts and combines the information gathered with resource metadata to visualize cloud application access connectivity. It brings you the security status   of your applications by highlighting applications and assets that violate the policy you have defined.</p>
        <p class="normal"><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" />'s global application visibility includes topological maps of your assets and applications in the cloud, showing their connections outside of the application and compliance with your security policy. You can drill right down to see the effective access to each and every asset.</p>
        <p>In the <MadCap:variable name="local.Kubernetes" /> environment, you can see the network connections, Kubernetes network policies  and vulnerabilities in containers, pods and services. View the pods, services, nodes, Kubernetes network policies and network traffic in your cluster and identify traffic  that is not compliant with your defined policy. </p>
        <p class="SubHead1">Policy</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="local-iris.ProductName" /> lets you define a global security policy for your  <MadCap:variable name="local.public cloud" /> that is checked against the effective connectivity set up in  your cloud vendor accounts. <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> automation then discovers violations and configuration issues in your environment. Similarly, in <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> you can create a set of policy rules  for your <MadCap:variable name="local.Kubernetes" /> cluster. Building your cluster policy is made easy by using 'learning mode', which presents all new connections for your consideration and add them to the whitelist policy in a click.

        <p class="SubHead1">Enforcement of Your <MadCap:variable name="local.Kubernetes" /> Cluster Policy </p><MadCap:variable name="local.Kubernetes" /> is shipped without any protection whatsoever from <MadCap:variable name="local.Kubernetes" /> <MadCap:variable name="local.NetworkPolicies" />. <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> lets you enforce a first line of protection by locking down any-any-any-allow connection attempts even before you have built your policy. Once you have a security policy of allowed connections you can enforce it on the cluster as Kubernetes network policies and other mechanisms of protection.

        <p class="SubHead1"><MadCap:variable name="local.Kubernetes" /> Automation</p><p class="normal"><MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> provides a number of features that help you identify security issues before deploying your containers and maintain a unified security policy that can be applied outside of the cluster.</p><ul><li>Immutable policy control - automated policy creation built into your CI/CD pipeline. </li><li>Scanning of Docker container images for vulnerabilities and giving an appropriate <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.TufinScore" /> to each container. <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_L" /> computes a <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.TufinScore" /> for each active service. The <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.TufinScore" /> gives you instant insight into the security of the services you utilize in your application and can be added as a step to your CI/CD pipeline.</li><li>Integration of vulnerability scans into your code repository, implemented as a badge in your readme file. The Tufin badges are an effective way to highlight security issues to the application developers as they develop the application.</li><li>Application of your policy to firewalls via <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.SC" /> and directly on Microsoft's Azure Firewall.</li></ul><p class="SubHead1">Will <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> Work on Our Infrastructure?</p><p><MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_S" /> can monitor <MadCap:variable name="local.public cloud" /> vendors <MadCap:variable name="local.AWS" /> and <MadCap:variable name="local.Azure" />. It integrates into any Kubernetes platform, any build server and any code repository. Your <MadCap:variable name="local.Kubernetes" /> application can be monitored on vanilla implementations, <MadCap:snippetText src="../Kubernetes/Standard_Kubernetes.flsnp" />.</p><p class="SubHead1">What Next?</p><ul><li> Familiarize yourself with <MadCap:xref href="../Kubernetes/Architecture.htm">Cluster Architecture</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../PublicCloud/Global_View.htm">Global Application Visibility</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="ConceptOfPolicy.htm">The Concept of Policy</MadCap:xref>.</li><li>If you haven't signed up yet, <a href="SignUp.htm">sign up</a> now</li><li>Do <a href="InitialSetup.htm">initial setup</a></li><li><a href="HowToWorkWith.htm"><MadCap:xref href="HowToWorkWith.htm">How to Work With [%=local.ProductName%]</MadCap:xref></a></li></ul></body>
