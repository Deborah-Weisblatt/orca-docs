        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" />, an exception is a user-defined condition that causes <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> to ignore certain policy violations. The existence of an exception can change the statistical data displayed on the <a href="Dashboard.htm"><MadCap:variable name="local.Dashboard" /></a> and also suppress warnings from appearing elsewhere in the product, such as screen elements appearing in red and warning icons on assets. In other cases, properties that would have constituted a violation are displayed in a strike-through font to indicate they are currently not considered violations of policy. The change in behavior caused by the exception is canceled if the exception is deleted.</p>
